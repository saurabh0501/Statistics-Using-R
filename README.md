# Statistics-Using-R
This repository contains the lab work that I did as part of the course "Data Science Fundatmentals using R" taken at University of Washington.
Some of the hands on labs included exploring data, working with data, data wrangling, descriptive analysis, webscrapping, statistical theory, regression and prediction.
